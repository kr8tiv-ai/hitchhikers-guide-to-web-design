// gsd-pi — Regression test for #2212 defect B (dismissal mechanism)
//
// When an auto-mode unit is abandoned while an ask_user_questions round is
// still pending, the hosting turn must be aborted. The dismissal path is the
// tool's abort signal: showInterviewRound registers an abort listener that
// finishes the round (done()), which unmounts the TUI dialog and restores
// transcript key bindings. This pins that mechanism: an abort while the round
// is pending resolves the dialog exactly once with an interrupted result.
//
// The wiring under test (unit-abandon → ctx.abort) is covered in
// gsd/tests/auto-orchestrator.test.ts.
