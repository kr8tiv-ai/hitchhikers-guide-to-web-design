/**
 * Live workflow: tiny pre-seeded milestone, real agent, single-unit dispatch.
 *
 * Seeds a one-slice/one-task milestone whose task is "make answer() return
 * 42" (the bundled test fails until then), then dispatches ONE unit with
 * `gsd headless next` — a real agent turn that edits the code and passes the
 * host-owned verification gate, after which step-mode exits 0. This is the
 * fast, cheap smoke of one dispatch; test-multi-slice-auto.ts runs the full
 * `auto` loop over three dependent slices to milestone completion.
 *
 * Proof is durable only — never agent prose: exit code + the task's own
 * verification command + git history.
 *
 * Exit: 0 pass · 77 skip (no creds) · non-zero fail.
