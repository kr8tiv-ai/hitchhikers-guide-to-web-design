# Changelog: OpenGSD Path app

Changes to the desktop app in `daemon/app` and the monitor daemon it bundles.
The app has its own version and `app-v<version>` tags, separate from the
[npm package](../../CHANGELOG.md). Newest first.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed
- Guard hooks **Refresh** and **Add guards** work on a project with the old
  runtime layout (`.gsd-path/runtime/`). The app migrates the runtime first, in
  the same click, in place of the error "legacy runtime requires
  --runtime-migrate before refresh". Migration changes only `.gsd-path` files
  and leaves them as an unstaged Git change to review.
- **Add guards** adds the guards for the agents that have GSD Path skills
  installed on this computer. With no agent installed, it changes nothing and
  tells you to install the skills for an agent first.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-03

### Changed
- macOS builds are signed with a Developer ID certificate and notarized by
  Apple, so macOS no longer shows "Apple could not verify OpenGSD Path". The
  app opens without an approval in Privacy & Security.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-02

First tester pre-release. Builds have no OS code signature.

### Added
- One app for macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), Windows, and Linux, with a tray
  icon and a tray popover.
- Setup: checks for Python 3.9+ and Git and shows the fix when one is missing;
  picks coding agents, installs skills, and chooses watched folders.
- Move from the old tray apps: the first launch removes the old LaunchAgent,
  Startup shortcut, systemd unit, and Swift login item, and turns on launch at
  login only when each one is gone.
- Projects board and project page: phases, milestones, tasks, reviews, verify
  history, usage, files at any Git version, and full recorded evidence.
- Skills page: installed and latest version per agent, release picker,
  preview, install, update, and uninstall with a plan.
- Project setup: runtime update and restore, guard hooks, health check, member
  hooks, and member marker repair.
- Settings: updates, Path settings, monitoring, usage and prices, launch at
  login, appearance, logs, and a diagnostics report.
- Stats: tokens and cost per day, time per phase, tasks per wave, and verify
  history.
- Environment editor for a project's `.env` files: values masked, one value
  shown on request, and a diff before each save.
- Signed self-update: the app asks before it installs and refuses an update
  whose signature does not match.

### Security
- The monitor the app starts accepts changes only with a local token that
  never enters the app's web view.
- Skills install from the npm release only after its sha512 matches the
  registry.

### Known limits
- No coordinator and member rows on the projects board.
- "Add project", "Open in agent", and "Remove everything" are not built.
- The Swift menu-bar app and the browser dashboard still exist beside the app.
