#### Model Capabilities

# Image-to-Video

Transform a still image into a video by providing a source image along with an optional prompt. The model animates the image content based on your instructions. On `grok-imagine-video-1.5`, image-to-video supports native 1080p. Sending `image` alone is image-to-video. Combining it with `last_frame`, `keyframes`, or `reference_images` is reference-to-video with that image as the pinned first frame. See [First & Last frame](/developers/model-capabilities/video/reference-to-video#first--last-frame) and [Keyframes](/developers/model-capabilities/video/reference-to-video#keyframes).

You can provide the source image as:

* A **public URL** pointing to an image
* A **base64-encoded data URI** (e.g., `data:image/jpeg;base64,...`)
* A **`file_id`** from the [Files API](/developers/files) — see [Imagine → Files API Integration](/developers/model-capabilities/imagine/files/inputs)

The demo below shows this in action; hold to animate a still image:

In the Vercel AI SDK, the `prompt` parameter accepts an object with `image` and `text` fields for image-to-video generation. The `image` field can be a URL string, base64-encoded string, `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, or `Buffer`.
